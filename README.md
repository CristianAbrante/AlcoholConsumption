This project from the website _Our World in Data_ presents the trends in Alcohol Consumption and Substance Use in countries all over the world, with data from 1990 to 2016. The aim is to give a better understanding of the global prevalence of substance use disorders.

Some of the conclusions are:

- Across most countries, the number of alcohol use disorders is higher than other drug use disorders.
- Substance use disorders are more common among men than women.

## Finding Data

In this section, you will identify and download at least 3 sources of data related to your domain of interest described above (into a folder you create called data/). You won't be required to use all of these sources, but it will give you practice discovering data. If your data is made available through a Web API, you don't need to download it. For each source of data, provide the following information:

- Where did you download the data (e.g., a web URL)?
- How was the data collected or generated? Make sure to explain who collected the data (not necessarily the same people that host the -data), and who or what the data is about?
- How many observations (rows) are in your data?
- How many features (columns) are in the data?
- What questions (from above) can be answered using the data in this dataset?
